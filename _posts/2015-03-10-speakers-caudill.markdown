Caudill, who oversees the creative direction of Shinola, has more than 20 years of experience in the creative arenas of apparel, accessory design, and development, as well as styling and brand consulting for companies such as Adidas, Old Navy, and Fossil. It’s no exaggeration to say that even the most seemingly minute detail of Shinola begins with Caudill, down to the color of the fixtures in the flagship stores and the type of wood used for the desks in the Detroit office (walnut). Although everything at Shinola is the result of collaboration, it's safe to say that none of it would exist without his enthusiasm and imagination.

Born in Trinidad & Tobago and raised in Montana, Caudill eventually wound up in L.A., where he attended the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. After school he became the apparel designer at L.A. Gear, then the global product designer at Adidas, helping to take the company to a global audience. From there he moved on to styling photo shoots for music videos and commercials, eventually becoming a design consultant for major American brands. This work brought Caudill to Dallas, where he began to fill in the details of the Shinola vision when the company was just an idea among a handful of friends.

Now he’s living out that Shinola vision in Detroit, and he’s incredibly excited about being there. In fact, Caudill was behind the scenes pushing for the move to Detroit from the very beginning. “There are certain cities or places that undergo truly pivotal moments, moments that history will look back on. I believe this is one of those moments in Detroit,” he says. “To be able to experience it firsthand and to participate in it… Well, if you’re not excited about that prospect, then maybe you should check your pulse.”
