As the founder of Framestore’s Digital Department, Mike Woods has been propelling its digital capabilities forward for the last 10 years. Working out of London and New York, he’s helped transform the fledgling department into one of the most creative and nimble in the industry, channeling Framestore’s 20-plus years of TV and film knowledge into quality and innovative content for interactive use. 

With creative and technical knowledge of all things gaming, social, Web, and experiential, Woods has become a pioneer of new techniques. One in particular is real-time animation, a technique he’s used in successful campaigns for Coca-Cola, Geico, Penguin, and Beats by Dre. Effectively pushing an Oscar-winning VFX studio into real-time rendering game engines, in spring 2014, Woods launched Framestore’s VR Studio, a dedicated game engine content studio for Virtual Reality. From the groundbreaking <em>Game of Thrones Oculus Rift</em> exhibit, launch apps for the Samsung GearVR, “The Teleporter" for Marriott Hotels, and a tour of the <em>Endurance</em> spaceship from Christopher Nolan’s film <em>Interstellar</em>, the VR projects are delivering thick and fast. Woods also has the unique honor of being part of the 2013 Creativity 50, alongside Jay-Z and Daft Punk.
