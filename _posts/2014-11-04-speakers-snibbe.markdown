His art is in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, which in 2014 acquired his collaboration with Björk, the <em>Biophilia App Album</em>, as the first app in its collection. His work has been incorporated into concert tours, Olympic ceremonies, museums, airports, and other major public spaces and events, and he’s collaborated on interactive projects with musicians and filmmakers including Philip Glass, Beck, and James Cameron. He received the Webby and Ars Electronica awards, as well as grants from the National Science Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
