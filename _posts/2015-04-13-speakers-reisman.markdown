Garrett Reisman is responsible for working with NASA to prepare SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to carry astronauts. He was the SpaceX project manager for CCDev2&mdash;a $75 million partnership with NASA to mature the Dragon spacecraft launch abort system and crew accommodations. Reisman then became the SpaceX project manager for CCiCap&mdash;a $460 million partnership with NASA to complete the design of the Dragon-Falcon 9 crew vehicle, perform hardware testing, ensure astronaut safety, and pave the way for NASA certification of the vehicle. Reisman then led the SpaceX proposal team and captured a $2.6 billion award for CCtCap&mdash;NASA’s latest commercial crew program intended to complete vehicle certification and fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station and back up to seven times. Reisman is currently the director of crew operations, responsible for all vehicle crew interfaces including displays, controls, spacesuits, human factors, and crew health and medical issues.

He has flown on two space shuttle missions, during which he logged more than three months in space including over 21 hours of extravehicular activity (EVA) in three spacewalks. Dr. Reisman served with both the Expedition-16 and the Expedition-17 crews as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station.
