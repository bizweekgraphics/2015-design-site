Adi Tatarko is the CEO and co-founder of Houzz, the leading platform for home remodeling and design, bringing together both professionals and homeowners via mobile, local, and social tools. Adi and her husband, Alon Cohen, started Houzz to help with challenges they faced during their own remodeling process. Today, millions of homeowners and more than 500,000 active home professionals connect through Houzz.com and its mobile apps every month, sharing their photos, advice, and product recommendations. Earlier in her career, Adi founded a software company that developed products and services for the high-tech industry. She lives in Palo Alto with her husband and three boys. In her spare time, she still enjoys looking at inspiring home design and renovating the rest of her own house, one room at a time.
