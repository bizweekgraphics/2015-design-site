Rachel Comey is a New York-based designer, whose namesake brand includes a women's collection of clothing, shoes, and accessories, as well as a men's collection of shoes and accessories.

Originally from Hartford, Connecticut, Comey graduated from the University of Vermont as an art major with a focus on sculpture. For many years she denied her interest in fashion, instead opting to collaborate with friends on a variety of creative projects in art, costume, and set design. After 10 years in Vermont, Comey moved to New York in 1998 to further pursue opportunities in the arts. Her collaboration with the band Gogol Bordello, for whom she designed stage sets and costumes, garnered her a place along with the rest of the group in the 2001 Whitney Biennial.

In September 2001, Comey launched her eponymous collection of menswear inspired by the young music scene in New York. Thanks to strong word of mouth, the collection proved a success, and she began to develop a loyal following. The natural next step for Comey was to add womenswear to her burgeoning business. The women's collection quickly took off and developed its own grassroots following. Her collections became known for their artful custom prints, graceful modern silhouettes, a handcraftsmanship, and carefully chosen materials.

Although in subsequent years Comey shifted her focus to womenswear, she continued to develop her popular men's shoe and accessory collection. The newest collection, for SS09, features her signature handcrafted oxfords in a variety of summer hues, as well as playful spins on everyday classics like espadrilles, moccasins, and desert boots. This collection also marks the introduction of her first vegan shoe.

Although her current collections can found in more than 100 stores internationally, the continued success of the brand is still largely due to word of mouth, and by appealing to the intelligence and independence of her customers, who appreciate the thoughtful details and offbeat charm manifest in her designs.

Comey is a member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and splits her time between NYC and her converted-laundromat home near a beach on Long Island's North Fork.
