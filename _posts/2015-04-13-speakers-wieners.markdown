Bradford (Brad) Wieners was named executive editor of <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> in February 2011. In addition to supervising the magazine’s features and Etc. (lifestyle) sections, he’s contributed numerous cover stories and features, including a recent one on MOAS, a privately funded search-and-rescue operation in the Mediterranean; Lego, the Danish toy company; a profile of Clay Christensen, often considered the world’s leading business theorist; and, with technology editor Jim Aley, an interview with Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt about Steve Jobs, completed just hours after the Apple co-founder died. Wieners also oversees <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>’s annual Design Issue.
