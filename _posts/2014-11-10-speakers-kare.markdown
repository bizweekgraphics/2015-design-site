After graduating from New York University with a Ph.D. in fine arts, Susan Kare took a curatorial job at an art museum and quickly realized she was on the wrong side of the creative equation. In 1982 she began work at Apple Computer designing fonts, icons, and graphic elements for the nascent Macintosh operating system and applications. In 1986, Kare followed Steve Jobs to Next Computer as the 10th employee and creative director. She was the founding partner in 1989 of Susan Kare Design, a graphic design practice in San Francisco, and has since designed thousands of icons for hundreds of clients, as well as many corporate identity and other projects, from Microsoft’s Solitaire cards to Facebook’s virtual gifts. Since 2011, she’s also been creating limited-edition fine art icon prints at Kareprints.com.
