Dolly Singh is the founder and CEO of Thesis Couture, a fashion-technology company based in Los Angeles. Thesis has brought together a remarkable team of technologists and experts from fashion, architecture, medicine, and engineering to reinvent the iconic stiletto. Offering high-end aesthetic looks with an advanced internal architecture developed using structural design and advanced materials, the team is creating the worldâ€™s first "high performance + high fashion" high heels.

Dolly was formerly the head of talent at Oculus VR, a disruptive gaming and virtual-reality technology company, which was recently acquired by Facebook for $2 billion-plus. She was tasked with building a best-in-class team and talent practices to support the business as it prepares to launch its revolutionary digital platform and hardware system, the Oculus Rift.

Previously she was the head of talent acquisition at SpaceX, where she was responsible for talent across all engineering, operations, and business teams; and worked closely with the CEO and entire executive team to grow the company from about 200 employees to almost 4,000 in five years.

Prior to SpaceX, she was the owner and managing principal at a boutique consulting firm with Fortune 50 clients in the aerospace, defense, and biotechnology sectors. Her experience spans all aspects of human capital with an emphasis on disruptive entrepreneurship models.
