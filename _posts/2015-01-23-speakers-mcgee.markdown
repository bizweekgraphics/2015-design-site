Framestore co-founder and Creative Director Mike McGee has directed for some of the U.K.’s most well-known brands, including the BBC, Next, and Robinsons, which sent him up in the “vomit comet” to shoot a commercial in zero gravity. His most recent directing work has been for O2, where Jonesy the cat was transported into space as part of the company’s ongoing “Be More Dog” campaign. Having worked in the industry for more than 25 years, McGee is highly awarded in his field and has an unrivaled eye for detail.

McGee’s skills as a live-action director are welded to an exceptional understanding of visual effects. His credits as a VFX supervisor include the BBC’s <em>Walking with Dinosaurs</em>, feature films <em>Nanny McPhee</em> and <em>Your Highness</em>, and advertising campaigns for General Electric and ESPN. McGee has also given talks at various events around the world, including Ciclope and the Great Festival of Creativity, while writing articles for well-known publications such as the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Marketing</em> magazine.
