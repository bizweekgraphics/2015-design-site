Nicole Dosso joined SOM in 1998. A recognized expert in the technical challenges and solutions associated with the design of tall buildings in complex urban contexts, Dosso has extensive project experience that includes work on SOM’s key projects at the World Trade Center site: Seven World Trade Center and One World Trade center. Dosso’s other high-rise work in New York includes the Baccarat Hotel and Residences, developed by Starwood Capital Group; the 250 West 55th Street commercial office building, for Boston Properties; 383 Madison Avenue, the former Bear Stearns headquarters; and the exterior renovation of 2 Broadway, a 1.2 million-square-foot office tower in the financial district which houses the Metropolitan Transit Authority. 

Dosso is involved in the Manhattan West Platform, a 2.6-acre, post-tension precast platform being built over the railroad tracks between 31st and 33rd Streets, Dyer Avenue, and 9th Avenue for Brookfield Office Properties.  She’s also working on the master plan development for the site, which is slated to have 19.0 FAR and 4.7 billion square feet of property for office, residential, hotel, and retail use, as well as a landscaped plaza connecting the proposed buildings. Other current projects include a 1 million-square-foot, 70-story, mixed-use building for the Related Company at the Hudson Yards site in New York.  She’s also involved in a 2.1 million-square-foot Four Seasons brand mixed-use building in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and a variety of other commercial, residential, and hospitality projects throughout the Middle East.

In 2013, Dosso was the key speaker at the Design Future Council’s Leadership Summit on Sustainable Design. She’s been featured in articles in Fast Company, an Architect, Gotham, and the Architectural Record, and profiled on Fox News in a segment called “Rise of Freedom: World Trade Center Architect Nicole Dosso Helps Rebuild NYC’s Skyline.” She has also received numerous commendations: the Cascieri Lectureship in the Humanities award at Boston Architectural College, an AIA Presidential Citation, a Building Design + Construction 40 Under 40 award, and a Crain's New York Business 40 Under 40 award. In 2006 she was honored by Professional Women in Construction for her contributions on rebuilding the World Trade Center site. Dosso is a member of AIA and a LEED-accredited professional with specialty in BD + C, and a graduate of the School of Architecture at Syracuse University.
