Marco Tempest is a cyber illusionist, combining magic and technology to produce astonishing illusions. He began his performing career as a stage magician and manipulator, winning many awards and establishing an international reputation as one of the world's most unique performers. His interest in computer-generated imagery led him to incorporating video and digital technology in his work and the development of a new form of contemporary illusion. The expansion of the Internet and social media provided more opportunities for digital illusions and ways of interacting with audiences and creating magically augmented realities. Marco is a keen advocate of the open-source community, working with artists, writers, and technologists to create new experiences and research the practical uses of the technology of illusion. Marco continues to perform around the world, is a media consultant on the subject of magic and illusion, and lectures at international conferences on the psychology of deception and creative thinking. Marco is a Director's Fellow at the MIT Media Lab.
