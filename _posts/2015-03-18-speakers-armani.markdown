Selvaggia Armani studied architecture at the Politecnico of Milan, graduating in 1984. While there, she also became interested in graphic arts and painting. In 1995, she took part in a group exhibition at the Galleria delle Arti in Bologna and had a solo show at the Galleria L’Isola in Trento, her home town. 

Armani’s work in textiles began soon after. Since 1997, she’s designed and manufactured her own brand of textiles and clothing. Since 2007, she’s collaborated on home accessories with .Exnovo, one of Italy’s leaders in 3D digital printing. She established Selvaggia Armani Handpainted, which produces leather accessories and ceramics, in 2013. She also began working recently with Edelman Leather; already, her Edelman “Flower” pattern is a finalist for an Interior Design Best of the Year award.

Since 2012, Armani has created an entire collection of jewelry for .Bijouets using the 3D digital printing technique. Her jewelry has been exhibited at the Vicenzaoro fair, the Museum of Art and Design in New York, the Museo del Gioiello in Vicenza, the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, and in “Designer’s Joy,” a group exhibition of 20 artists. Her jewelry is sold at London’s Tate Modern Gallery and several other museum design stores.
